# Media Transceiver using BladeRF â€“ EN2130 Communication Design Project

This project was developed as project of the *EN2130 â€“ Communication Design Project*. It demonstrates a *point-to-point digital wireless communication system* using *BladeRF* to transmit and receive arbitrary files. Currently implemented for *File transmission* over the *2.4 GHz ISM band* using BladeRF hardware and GNU Radio.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Requirements (From EN2130 Specification)

- Implement a point-to-point *digital wireless communication* system using SDRs.
- Support transmission of:
  - Images âœ… 
  - Voice âœ… 
  - Video âœ… 
- Operate in *2.4 GHz ISM band* within legal power limits.
- Include a *user interface* for operation.
- Performance evaluation:
  - With distance
  - End-to-end delay
- Optional features (future work):
  - Security
  - Channel estimation
  - Adaptive transmission

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- Transmitter.py â€“ Transmitter script  
  Converts a file to .tmp format with a header/footer, then transmits using QPSK modulation over SDR.

- Receiver.py â€“ Receiver script  
  Receives .tmp file, detects the header/footer, and reconstructs the original file.
